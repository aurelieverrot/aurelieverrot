### Hi There ðŸ‘‹

I am Aurelie (she/her), Software Engineer from California working at Zendesk in the Internationalization (i18n) team, where I maintain and build the tools to provide localized content to all Zendesk products. I mostly work with Ruby on Rails, on the Backend. 

I am also an editor and the English translator for the [WomenOnRails newsletter](https://womenonrailsinternational.substack.com/)

### Skills Shaker
I use Ruby, and also some Python and Javascript.
I store with PostgreSQL and MySQL.
I made my way through some DevOps tickets.
I have experience in tiny, little, medium, and HUGE codebases.
I train, mentor, cheer up.
I can explain one thing or two about Internationalization (i18n).
I am internationally acclaimed for my documentation (not for my typos, but I can use the English Second Language card for that).
I can make good cakes for my colleagues, though since I work remotely I eat them.
And my French accent can make the grumpiest person laugh.
