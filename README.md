### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aurelie (pronounced "Oh-Ray-Lee"), and I am a Software Engineer from California.

I started coding in late 2019, did a bootcamp with General Assembly in San Francisco from January to April 2020, and I am actually doing some freelancing as a Ruby on Rails developer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working for the company Per Angusta until December 2020. I work with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, mostly on backend.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rails. I am new to it, there is a lot I have to learn. Same for PostgreSQL.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects about health, education, and environment. It's my TriForce :) I am open to other subjects as long as I can learn from them. I can work with Javascript, Python, and Ruby.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with... debugging. I would love to be more confident with it!

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about... my French? Cooking? Jokes?

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: on LinkedIn, I am the one and only Aurelie Verrot. On Twitter @LiliVerrot.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She / Her

- âš¡ Fun fact: Hire me and I'll make you crÃªpes.
