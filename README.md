### Skills Shaker
* I mainly use Ruby and Rails, but I also can do a thing or two with Python and Javascript.
* I like GitHub Actions, I don't like their Cron feature that is not supporting timezones.
* I can explain what is i18n, but also L10n, and more importantly why you shouldn't mix them up.
* I have experience in tiny, little, medium, and HUGE codebases.
* I train, mentor, and cheer up.
* I am interna(tiona)lly acclaimed for my documentation (not for my typos, but I can use the English Second Language card for that).
* I can make good cakes for my colleagues, though since I work remotely I eat them.
* And my French accent can make the grumpiest person laugh.
